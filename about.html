        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am an Agile Web Developer student at ProjectCodex , a computer training school in
            Cape
            Town. I am on a journey of learning how to develop
            softwares using code. I am dedicated to my work, optimistic and hard working.
            I am open to learning new skills every day and gain more knowledge in things that I
            do. I
            get my work done whenever I put my mind to it,
            and I love challenges because they make me realize my capabilities to solve
            problems. My
            skills are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript </p>
