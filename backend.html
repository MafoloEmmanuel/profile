                    <h3> Unit Testing</h3>
                    <p>In this project I learned to setup mocha in the terminal and run unit tests using mocha
                        in
                        the
                        terminal using the npm test command. To link Travis CL to my GitHub account so that I
                        can
                        link a
                        repository that I want to use to run my code in Travis to do unit testing there and also
                        create a
                        Travis file that's going to allow me to execute the NodeJS. I learned how to perform
                        unit
                        testing
                        for all my bootcamp functions in the terminal</p>

                    <h3>Settings Bill WebApp</h3>
                    <p> The project shows the total for the bill of calls and smses made. You set your own cost for the call and sms, and also the warning and critical levels.
                        Select the call or sms radio button to make a call/sms. Totals updates when the ADD button is pressed.
                        If the total cost exceed the warning level show the total cost in orange, if it exceeds the
                        critical level show it in red and prevent any new costs from being added. </p>

                    <h3>Greetings WebApp</h3>
                    <p>In this project I learned How to create a webpage in which a user puts a name in a textbox
                        and the the select a language in which they want to greet the name in. So the user has to
                        choose between three languages. After the user put a name and select a language , a
                        greetings message has to be displayed saying for example "Hello, Emmanuel". The app stores
                        the names of people who are already greeted.</p>
