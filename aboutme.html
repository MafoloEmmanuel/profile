        <h3>About Emmanuel Tsheledi Mafolo</h3>
        <p>I have a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science in addition to my Agile Web Developer Certificate. I'm
            proficient in SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a great sense of design, planning, and implementation,
            as well as intuitive problem-solving abilities.I make a plan for my work using Agile Scrum methodology
            called KanBanFlow and follow the tasks I have when doing my work. I am goal-oriented and work well in a
            team. I am capable of managing myself effectively during independent projects and as part of a productive
            team.
            My goal is to become a full-stack web developer. To continuously improve my knowledge about web development
            and one day become a senior web developer. To positively influence young people from rural areas like me to
            learn about coding technologies and become exposed to the real world. To build an app that is going to be
            very useful</p>

        <h4>What excites me</h4>
        <p>Finally fixing a bug after long hours of challenge and struggle is what I like the most. Coding allows people
            to build cool projects and showcase their creativity and be innovative. What excites me about software
            development is the creation of software applications with code. The ability to convert just an idea to
            become a real thing like an app. The software development field allows you to choose the kind of work
            environment lifestyle that fits you, you get a chance to work remotely while at home as long as you have a
            reliable internet and place. There are always new tools and better techniques to design software to learn
            about.</p>
