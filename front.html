                        <h3>Basic Webpage </h3>
                        <p>In this project I have created two versions of the same web page. In the first
                            version of
                            the webpage I used HTML and CSS with no framework and the second version I have
                            used
                            HTML and CSS simple grid framework. Both the webpages are responsive and can
                            resize
                            according to any screen that is used.</p>

                        <h3>Bootcamp Unit Testing</h3>
                        <p>In this project I learned how to test my bootcamp functions. I learned how to use
                            ChaiJS
                            asserts to check function results. Write code in the unit test that is calling
                            the
                            function under test with different parameters checking if the function behaves
                            correctly. If it behaves correctly the results will be correct, but if not it
                            will
                            return a failure/error.</p>

                        <h3>DOM Widgets Intro </h3>
                        <p>I learned that the DOM is about the browser, what people can see and do with an
                            application. So we use the DOM to gather and display information from end users.
                            We
                            have
                            many DOM elements such as textboxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, div elements and
                            other
                            html tags. I learned about how the DOM loads and how to build a DOM widget.</p>

                        <h3>Unit Testing DOM Widgets</h3>
                        <p>In this project I learned that a factory function is a functions that can return
                            object
                            literals and
                            other functions. I
                            learned how to keep the application logic and the DOM code separate to make the
                            functions testable. To focus purely on testing the function logic and not the
                            DOM
                            code.
                            I learned how to use the factory functions to test my logic. To test all the
                            business
                            logic of my DOM widgets using Mocha.</p>

                        <h3>Greetings Exercise</h3>
                        <p>In this project I learned How to create a webpage in which a user puts a name in
                            a
                            textbox and the the select a language in which they want to greet the name in.
                            So
                            the
                            user has to choose between three languages. After the user put a name and select
                            a
                            language , a greetings message has to be displayed saying for example "Hello,
                            Emmanuel".
                            The app stores the names of people who are already greeted.</p>
